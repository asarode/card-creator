# card-creator
Super simple card creator for Maximum Alpha.

## Usage
Just upload a CSV file with the correct format and click "Print Deck." You can download the [example CSV](assets/demo.csv) as a guide on how your spreadsheet should be formatted.

## Development
Clone this repo and setup any HTTP server to serve index.html to any port. I recommend using [Python's Simple HTTP Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html). 

Just `cd` to within this folder from your terminal, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`, and navigate to http://localhost:8000/
